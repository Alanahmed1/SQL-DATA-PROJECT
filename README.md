3. What skills are most in demand for Data Scientist?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

To dive deep into the data scientist job market, I utilized several key tools:

- **SQL:** The core of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system I chose, ideal for managing and analyzing job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred editor for writing and executing SQL queries, as well as managing database tasks.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control, collaboration, and sharing SQL scripts and analysis throughout the project.

# The Analysis

Each query in this project was designed to explore specific aspects of the data scientist job market. Below is an overview of the approach taken for each key question:
